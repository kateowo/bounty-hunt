# Bounty Hunt

Minecraft Bounty Hunt. You are given a random target player you have to kill, if you succeed you earn points. If you kill someone who had you as their target you can also gain points, however killing anyone else will subtract points. First to 8000 will win, who will come out victorious?

## Basic outline

The datapack will be 99% hardcoded values, based on the scoreboard objectives for `killedByTeam.[team]`. As it's based on that objective, it will run based on if a player(team) was killed by a specific player(team). eg. it will check if aqua has a scoreboard `killedByTeam.red` of 1 - and if red had a bounty on aqua they will be rewarded points.

The first to a set amount of points / a timer will decide the winner.
