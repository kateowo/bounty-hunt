# Bounty Hunt

Minecraft Bounty Hunt. Not sure if the project will ever be fully released or if it will be dropped (L) but here goes nothing. - 25/12/2021

## Basic outline

The datapack will be 99% hardcoded values, based on the scoreboard objectives for `killedByTeam.[team]`. As it's based on that objective, it will run based on if a player(team) was killed by a specific player(team). eg. it will check if aqua has a scoreboard `killedByTeam.red` of 1 - and if red had a bounty on aqua they will be rewarded points.

The first to a set amount of points / a timer will decide the winner.

^ not sure if any of this is accurate anymore YEP
